# Workshop: Building Realtime Apps with PubNub JavaScript SDK

This provides step-by-step tutorials of building realtime web applications using PubNub global data stream network.

[PubNub](https://pubnub.com) is a globally distributed data stream network that allows you to build real-time applications easily. Its core feature, pub/sub, sends and receives data between multiple users simultaneously.

You will be learning how to write simple applications using PubNub JavaScript SDK 3.x.

## Getting Started with PubNub

Sign up [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/get-started/) to get your own API keys.

Once you are signed up, you need to get your own keys to get started:

1. Go to [admin.pubnub.com](https://admin.pubnub.com)
2. Create a new app by entering an app name (e.g. chat-app), and press **Create a New App**
3. Once the app is created, click the app from the dashboard. Now you should see your publish and subscribe keys.

## Get Started by Cloning the Repo

Clone this repo with git to your local working environment to get started.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pubnub/javascript-workshop.git
```

Or just download the zip file, and unzip in your working directory.

Your starting point, js/**app.js** has very minimal code that scaffold the app you're going to build, while **final-app.js** contains the entire code you can reference any time throughout the workshop.

Also, **index.html** and css/**style.css** have been completed for you, but feel free to modify the look-and-feel.

Now, let's get started!
